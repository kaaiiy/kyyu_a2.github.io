    <h1>One of My Enjoyments</h1>
    <p> <strong><a href="https://www.colorfulstage.com/" title="Project Sekai" target="_blank">Hatsune Miku Colorful Stage</a></strong> (also known as <strong>Project Sekai</strong>) is one of my favorite apps to play on my free time. I started 
        playing the game when it was first released in Japan and I wanted to wait for the global version (recently came out in December 2021)
        to come out. It is an anime music rhythm gacha game. <strong>Why do I enjoy it so much?</strong> It's because it is the first game that made me 
        get out of my comfort zone and meet so many nice people. I was able to make so many friends by joining the community (thanks
        to meeting a top tierer, a person who has lots of experience in the competitive side of the game, on Twitch). 
        I was also able to learn a lot more about the game in depth and attempted to aim for a specific rank which was <strong>first place</strong>
        for my favorite event, <strong>"You Deserve It! Break Time!"</strong>. With the support of my friends, I was able to achieve it in June! It was really
        difficult because it happened during when summer school started for me, but it was a really fun experience. <strong>Feel free to click on the image to see my 
        achievement!</strong>
